Result is false because equal method is not overriden properly,
as it accepts Employee object instead of Object type.This is method overloading
not overriding. contains method calls equals method of Object class which check memory
address. So, to get expected result we need to change equal method signature of
Employee class i.e. we need to change Employee type parameter to Object type
