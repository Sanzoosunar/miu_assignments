1. There are 7 callback queues in Node js, they are:
	a. timer : setTimeOut, setInterval callback are enqueue in this queue
	b. I/O  : readFile enqueue in this queue
	c. Polling : readFile first loads to Polling from LIBUV and then push to I/O
	d. Immediate : setImmediate callbacks enqueue
	e. Close : close callback
	f. Next Tick : process.nextTick are added in nextTick queue
	g. Promise : Promise callback added here
	
	
	
	
2. Console Output
	start
	end
	nextTick 1
	nextTick 2
	Promise...1
	Promise...2
	timeout 1
	timeout 2
	nextTick 3
	timeout 3
	
	
3. Console Output
	timeout
	readFile....
	Immediate
	
	Note: as per event loop rule, timer callback executes first follwed by I/O and Immediate callback. Before adding to specific queue V8 adds to 
	LIBUV, libuv then adds to their own queue. But sometimes LibUV takes time to process and add other queue first in their queue instead of timer
	.As they are asynchronous process they execute independently. So in this scenario order can be changed.
	
	
4. The output of this code is undefined because in node js, this keyword refers to empty object({ }) in global scope and refers to global object 
	inside function. var variables added to global scope not global object and they are different things. Therefore, when we try to callback
	this.message, it actually search in global object where it do not find any message properties. Therefore,it prints undefined value

5. It prints Josh Edward

6. It throws error because app.js file calling pattern2.js file which do not exists in current folder	

7. It throws error because app.js file calling pattern2.js file which do not exists in current folder	

8. Output is: { firstname: 'John', lastname: 'Smith' }
